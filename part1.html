				<p><u id="day1">Day One-</u>   Upon arrival in Iceland, I immediately picked up on the temperature. I'd expected it to be sub-zero, and had worn extra layers as a precaution. However, the dry chill seemingly did not have much bite in April, and with the sun out it very much felt very much like a pleasant Winter's day in North East England. The second thing that I noticed was just how remote, and just how small the capital city is. This would certainly go on to set the precedent for all of the locations that followed. The speed limit in Iceland is only 40mph, so I had plenty of time to take in the scenery. In each direction there was melting snow, distant mountains and refreshingly, not a whole lot else.  
				<br>
				<br>
				We arrived at the <a class="link" href="https://www.icelandairhotels.com/en/hotels/natura" target="blank">Hotel Natura</a> in the middle of the morning, local time. However, we had been awake since the very early hours back home, so we decided to have a bit of a nap before venturing out. The hotel staff were extremely friendly, and the room had everything we needed. We did have the option of an Airbnb, but with our busy itinerary and the special occasion that it was, we had no regrets of investing in a little extra comfort. We stayed there a couple of times during the week, and rated it very highly. 
				<br>
				<br>
				One of the perks of the hotel, was a free bus pass, which we later used to get into the main part of the city. Here we took a nice walk along the prom (with more mountains to check out on the horizon), then we had ourselves a beautiful Italian meal, followed by a stroll up the hill to the famous Hallgrímskirkja Church (below):</p>

			<p><i>The beer in this shot is called ‘Viking’, which came in various strengths and sizes. It proved to be good value for money at £9 a pint, and it also tasted fantastic (even Claire enjoyed it). I say value for money, but in all seriousness, we are talking about a country where 2 locally caught fish and chips costed us £70 later on!</i></p>

		<p><u id="day2">Day Two-</u> In the morning, we were picked up from the hotel, and taken to the Ishestar stables for a bit of horse riding. The stables were just outside of Reykjavik, but it felt like it was a million miles away. Claire did a lot of riding in her teens, whereas I’d only done it in Mexico three years earlier. We had chosen the <a class="link" href="https://www.ishestar.is/en/tour/lava-tour/" target="blank">‘Lava Tour’</a> due to its Trip Advisor reviews, and the fact that it catered for different abilities. Claire commented that the Icelandic horses were well cared for, and found the different 'gait' made for a more interesting experience. By the way, Claire has informed me that gait refers to the speed of the horse- I was none the wiser.
		<br>
		<br>
		The video found in the link should give you a better understanding of the ride, as it was very difficult for me to take photos on horseback! Despite my camera problems, I emerged as one of the more confident riders, and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. The whole thing lasted a couple of hours. Naturally, we had a very chilled evening afterwards.</p>

			<p><i>This photo of the two of us was taken during one of the breaks. I’d felt in control of the horse for most of the day, but as he recognised the spot, he ignored all command and helped himself to some grass! As you can see, Icelandic horses are smaller than regular horses, though a bigger one had to be found to carry all 6ft2” of me!</i></p>

		<p><u id="day3">Day Three-</u> Due to our limited time and ambitious itinerary, we decided that our first trip to Iceland should be guided to get the most out of the experience. As I would have been doing all the driving too, I am very glad that we picked Arctic Adventures after careful research. Our <a class="link" href="https://adventures.is/iceland/multiday-tours/multiday-adventures/golden-circle-south-coast-ice-cave/" target="blank">three day tour</a> was centred around the main sites of the south coast. The full itinerary can be found <a class="link" href="./index.html#itinerary" target="blank">here</a> if you missed it. The first leg of the journey consisted of the 'Golden Circle'.
		<br>
		<br>
		The 'Golden Circle' is comprised of Thingvelier National Park, Gulfoss Waterfalls, and Geysir. All three are no more than a couple of hours outside of Reykjavik, but again, it was crazy just how isolated in the frozen wilderness we felt in the tour minibus. While we came off it to visit these places, there is one main road that spans the whole of Iceland called the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland)" target="blank">'Ring Road'</a>. While it is surrounded by the most wondrous and otherworldly natural landscape I have ever seen, I would certainly not like to break down on it!</p>

				<p><i>We caught Thingvelier National Park on a very nice day, with no rain or fog. As you can see, there was still some snow still left over from the previous week. The park goes on for quite a while, though this viewpoint is a tourist hotspot, with a pleasant view of the lake. It would have been nice to explore this area more, but it was to be the first stop of many.</i></p>

			<p><i>The final stop on the Golden Circle was to see the 'Geysir'. Our word 'Geyser' comes from this Icelandic term. I admit that it was interesting to see the hot spring eject 20+ ft into the air every five minutes. However, this was perhaps the only anti-climax of the whole holiday. Once we'd seen it, we were ready for the next thing.</i></p>

	<div class="container">
		<p>Little did we know; the next thing was to be massive. It was at this point that we found out our glacier hike (supposedly at the end of our tour) had to be rescheduled to directly follow the Golden Circle. This was due to there being bad weather forecasted on the scheduled day. Ordinarily, we would have gone to our hotel and rested up, but we rolled up our sleeves and made the most of it. You can see this and more in <a class="link" href="./part2.html">Part 2</a> of the journal.</p>
