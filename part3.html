				<p><i>Diamond Beach was beautiful. On the black sand, there were chunks of ice that were flowing into the area from the nearby glacier lagoon, and then being swept into the sea. This was another sight that we had never-before experienced, so Claire and I really took our time on the walk along the shore. Here she can be seen getting some nice close up shots, one of which can be found in the <a class="link" href="./gallery.html#closeup" target="blank">'Trip Gallery'</a>.</i></p>

		<p>The part of the trip that I had been most looking forward to, was this very glacier lagoon. Jokusarlon turned out to be an incredible last chapter to our Arctic Adventures tour, and everything that I had hoped it would be. The page <a class="link" href="#jumbotronlagoon">banner</a> merely <i>hints</i> at the breadth and depth of this arctic-like panorama, and upon arrival I was absolutely awestruck. Jokulsarlon and Diamond Beach can apparently be unpredictable in terms of ice content, but fortunately for us, the place was covered in all manner of it.

		<p>After Jokulsarlon, we had a good 5-hour trip back to Reykjavik, via a stop for hot chocolate at another waterfall. This gave us both plenty of time to look back at photos and look back at what we had seen and done. We both agreed that this place was unlike any other that we had been in the world, and could not face the prospect of going home. Still, we had another few days left before our flight out on the 12th, and we happily checked back into the Hotel Natura later on. We had intended to do some Northern Light spotting, but we were so wiped out that we settled for Dominos Pizza delivered to the room, and an early night.
		<br>
		<br>
		<u id="day6">Day 6</u> involved us going to the Blue Lagoon. This is a commercialised hot spring not far outside of Reykjavik. I didn't want to risk taking the camera containing an SD card full of our adventures, so this <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmTyAUBY1U8" target="blank">video</a> should give you a bit of an overview. Despite being very touristy, I couldn't argue with a nice warm dip after everything we had done. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Back in Reykjavik, we watched Liverpool beat Manchester City in a place called <a class="link" href="https://enskibarinn.is/" target="blank">The English Pub</a>. Surprisingly, it was filled with mostly Icelandic folk; a lot of whom actually supported Liverpool. Claire went against her instincts by coming with me, as usually an evening full of football and beer is her idea of hell. She probably surprised herself in how much she enjoyed herself, and we even made a couple of friends. When Salah and Firmino secured a spot in the UCL semi-finals for Liverpool, she was jumping up and down with the rest of us! The evening was topped off nicely with a few cocktails and some live music. I'd definitely go back there.
		<br>
		<br>
		<u id="day7">Day 7</u> was scheduled to be a rest day, so nothing too eventful happened. After we packed our things, we did go into the city one last time, and celebrated our final meal at an authentic Icelandic restaurant called <a class="link" href="http://laekjarbrekka.is/" target="blank">Laekjarbrekka</a>. The fish here was absolutely superb, and naturally I ordered more Viking beer. Sad that we hadn't seen the Northern Lights, we spent a bit of time down at the prom. We did not get our reward there, so we hopped on the bus back to our hotel. Amazingly, at our last possible chance before heading in for the night, we did catch a tiny glimpse of them behind the clouds. The photo is not worth sharing, but for us it really rounded off a very special holiday.
