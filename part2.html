				<p>So, after a 3-hour drive, and already weary from the Golden Circle tour, we set off on a glacier hike. I had previously completed one on Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand, so very much knew what to expect. Claire was a little bit anxious, but it proved to be more of an uphill stroll than hike. Our guide was really entertaining, so we ended up laughing most of the way up anyway; and were soon reinvigorated by the fresh air. We found the way up was atypical of most glaciers in that there was so much black, due to the volcanic ash trapped in the ice. As you can see, we stopped frequently to take in some fantastic views.</p>

				<p><i>Here is where we peaked on our hike. Behind a now outdoor-enthused Claire, it's clear that the glacier has receded. The glacier lake at the bottom had once been all ice. This recession has happened within the last 10 years, with global warming certainly having a lot to answer for.</i></p>

		<p>It's fair to say that we slept well that evening. Our accomodation in the easily pronouncable 'Kirkjubaejarklaustur' was all organised by our Arctic Adventures guide very last minute, due to our change in itinerary. We stayed there on the following night too, and we were really satisfied with the quality of the hotel. But alas, we did not get a sniff of the Northern Lights whenever we ventured out. Definite first world problems!

		<br>
		<u id="day4">Day 4</u> began with a drive to the ice caves, via some interesting lava fields left over from the last major eruption. Supposedly, one eruption badly affected the farming in a lot of Western Europe due to the amount of ash blown over, and many generations struggled to survive. The remnants of this can be viewed on the <a class="link" href="./gallery.html#lava" target="blank">'Trip Gallery'</a>. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When we arrived at the meeting place for the ice caves, we missed the opportunity to get a comfortable seat on the next transport. We massively regretted being last on, as to get to the caves, we had to drive off road on the snow for about 45 minutes. I could not find a seatbelt, and banged my head several times! In the end, however, it was all worth it. These caves were located next to Katla Volcano, and in all my years travelling, I've never quite seen anywhere like it. It felt like we were on an expedition in the middle of the arctic.

				<p><i>It is worth mentioning that we faced many obstacles when taking these photos. The main one was this girl in the bright pink coat. Wherever there was a photo opportunity, she would always race to be the first there with her selfie-stick, and linger there for a good 3-4 minutes. When she was near us on the bus once, I couldn't help but notice that unusually, all of her photos featured her own face for 80% of the shot, and the actual sight taking up the small remainder. Even today I question her frustrating logic! By the way, this wasn't even our helicopter!</i></p>

		<p>The caves themselves were very impressive. We navigated three in total, using crampons and ropes. Claire and I have both since commented that this was one of our favourite parts of the whole holiday.

			<p><i>Helmets were necessary, as a lot of the ice was melting. I still remember the constant dripping sound in each cave, as well as occasionally being splashed! At any time, chunks of ice could have come crashing down, but luckily, we escaped unscathed. The result of the melting is that there were quite a lot of openings in the ceilings of the caves, as pictured.</i></p>

				<p><i>One of our favourite things about this location was the look of the cave walls. The ice was packed so densely that it retained the colour blue. As with many locations we encountered, the ash was frozen inside a prison of ice, leaving these unusual shadows.</i></p>

		<p>I wish we could have stayed in the caves for longer, but we still had so much to see. The main highlights of which were the Skogafoss waterfall (as featured in the show <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nMCJA9faSw" target="blank">'Vikings'</a>), and Reynisfjara basalt sea stacks. At the latter, there was, curiously, a black sand beach; showing the reach and depth of the volcanic ash. After a bumpy ride back to our main tour bus, this is where we concluded day four of our holiday.
